This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.7. This is an example application for how to convert your application into a progressive web application.

## Steps

2. Run `npm i -g http-server` to install a http server client globally.
3. Navigate to `dist/pwa` and run `http-server -o` to run the application.
4. Refresh the browser after the application loads up to register the service worker and cache all assets and data.
5. Disconnect from the network and refresh the application.

You would see the application loads up from the cache.
